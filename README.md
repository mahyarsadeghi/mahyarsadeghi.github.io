## About Data and Project

This website, built with GitHub pages service, provides several visualization charts and graphs, based on the extracted information from a dataset about the best selling music artist of all time. All the visualizations here are created for educational purposes in `Data Visualization` course in `@UniGe`, academic year 2022/2023, made by the `TATANKA` group.
