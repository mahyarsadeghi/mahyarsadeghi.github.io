                  The Geo Section is the section relative to the geographical

                  distribution, among the countries, of some interesting
                  metrics.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The first map of this section shows the geographical
                  distribution of the music sales, in terms of dollars ($).
                  Specifically we higlight, with the information inside the
                  tooltip, that appear hovering a country on the map, the total
                  amount of sales earned by each country, thanks to the best
                  selling music artists that belong to such country. Can be
                  interisting for discovering which are, globally, the countries
                  that have earned more money from their best music artist.

                  <br />
                  The second map displays, instead, the geographical
                  distribution of the sold music units, called TCU (total music
                  units). A single music units sold by an artist is equivalent
                  or to a sold album, or to 10 downloaded songs, or to 1500
                  streamed songs. Thanks to the information showed by the
                  tooltip, hovering a specific country, we can see what are the
                  total amount of TCU for each country. Can be interisting for
                  discovering which are, globally, the countries that have

                  the geographical distribution of the best selling music
                  artists of all time. Again we point out what is the total

                  The Time Section is the section relative to the time analysis
                  of the best selling music artist of all time, for discovering
                  some interest trends of genres, artists and sales through the
                  different years in which the artists were active.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The first chart of this section is an histogram that shows the
                  Period of activity's distribution of best selling music
                  artists through the years. There is the possibility to change
                  the number of bins used by the hostogram with the specific
                  input section. Hovering the bars of the chart the precise
                  interval of time associated to a bar is showed. With this
                  chart we are able to understand what are the period with more
                  music activity of the best selling music artists.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The second one compares the distribution of two genres's
                  period of activity through the years, using two histograms at
                  a time. In fact, it is possible to select, with the specific
                  dropdown menu, the different combination of genres to compare,
                  among the top 10 genres. The genres' name in the legend are
                  clickable. When you do that the relative histogram is hidden,
                  re-clicking on the same it is showed again. This can be used
                  for isolated one single histogram for obtaining a more clear
                  visualization on a single genre. This chart is nice for
                  knowing what are the most diffused period over the years for
                  each of the top 10 genres comparing also different genres
                  together.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The third chart is a mult-line plot and shows the trends of
                  the top 5 genres, for amount of music artists, through the
                  years. Each line represent the trend of a genre. Again
                  clicking on the genres' names in the legend the associated
                  line is hidden for being showed agin re-clicking on it.
                  Looking the chart we are able to knowing what are the
                  increasing or decreasing of each of the top 5 genres during
                  the time, understanding again what are the best music period
                  for each of them.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The last chart of this section is a stacked bar chart that
                  displays how much sales the top 5 genres (considering the
                  number of artists) have gained for each of the top 5
                  countries, until the 2023. Hovering each part of each bar we
                  can see the exact amount of sales of that genre for the
                  associated country. With this chart we can discover how the
                  sales of each of the considered country are distributed over
                  the different top 5 genres, through the years, 'till 2023.

                  The Genre & Artist Section is the section relative to the
                  genre & artist analysis of the best selling music artist of
                  all time, for understanding what are the most diffused and
                  profitable genres, or for retrieving interesting personale
                  info about the various music artist.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The first chart of this section is an horizontal bar chart
                  that shows the top 15 genres taking into account the number of
                  best selling music artist that belong to each of these genres.
                  Hovering each bar a toooltip will appear for showing the name
                  of the hovered genre and its exact number of artists. Can be
                  interesting to discover what are the most popular genres among
                  all the genres of the best selling music artists.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The second horizontal bar chart displays, instead, the top 15
                  genres considering their associated sales ($), or onsidering
                  their associated TCU (unit). There are two specific buttons
                  for changing the measure. Hovering the bars we can take a look
                  at the precise sales' value, in million (or billion) of
                  dollar, or the precise TCU's units. With this chart we are
                  able to understand what are the most profitable genres and
                  most diffused genres.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The third one is again an horizontal bar chart and shows the
                  top 20 best selling artist for what concern their sales amount
                  ($) and TCU (unit), based on the clicked button in the
                  specific section. Hovering each bar the relative tooltip shows
                  the value of sales, or TCU, for the desired artist. This chart
                  is useful for knowing what are the most profitable artist and
                  with more sold music.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The last chart of this section is a bubble chart in which we
                  can see what are the best artists, again or considering the
                  sales or the TCU, for each of the countries associated to the
                  best selling music artists. In the sales configuration there
                  are the best selling artists considering the sale amount
                  (y-axis), but the size of the bubbles are proportional to the
                  TCU of each artist. In the TCU scenario there are the best
                  selling artists considering the TCU (y-axis), but now the size
                  of the bubbles are proportional to the sales amount of each
                  artist. This chart is interesting because shows the fact that
                  it is not always true that the best selling artist of a
                  nation, considering revenue, is also the best selling artist
                  for what concerns the sold music units. In addition we can
                  discover that globally an artist that is first in sales cannot
                  be in the same position in TCU, as also the viceversa.
